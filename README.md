--This project is abandoned 

--This program does not work yet for N0RAMBoot. XmodemCRC is not implemented.

This is a Arduino program for use with the N0RAMBoot Cartdrige/BIOS for the Sega Master System.

It's goal is to make a simple way to make a stand alone version of your game/program without a computer or EEPROM programer.

Secondary goal is to make a multicart out of larger arduino compatibles or arduinos plus external memory.
